Syntax highlighting for ABAS FOP script language in english and german
for the use of gnome editor with gtk-sourceview-4. Older versions are not supported.

On a debian system do:
Install the .lang files into /usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs
Install mime .xml definition files into /usr/share/mime/packages
and run as root
        update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
Install .desktop file into /usr/share/applications

It has all the keywords, commands and funtions (as og abas version 2020),
but not all combinations of options.
